# MKLAB Corporation

MKLAB Corporation is a problem-solving technology lab focused on building **practical, accessible, and scalable solutions** for real-world challenges.

## What We Do
We design and build tools, platforms, and systems that address both **digital and physical-world problems**, serving communities across all environments.

MKLAB is **not limited to mobile apps, web apps, or any single operating system**.  
Instead, we analyze the problem first, then choose the most suitable technology — whether it runs on mobile, desktop, web, offline systems, or embedded environments.

## Our Philosophy
- Community impact comes first
- Technology is chosen by problem, not trend
- AI is used as a **tool**, not a replacement for human logic
- Offline and low-resource accessibility matters
- Learning never stops

> “Try to know everything, but you will never know everything.”

## What You’ll Find Here
- Selected open-source tools and utilities
- Educational and experimental projects
- APIs and platforms designed for real use
- Research and prototypes solving practical problems

Some projects are public to support learning and collaboration.  
Others are private and developed internally as part of MKLAB’s long-term vision.

## Mission
To build technology that **actually helps people**, empowers creators, and solves problems before they become crises.
